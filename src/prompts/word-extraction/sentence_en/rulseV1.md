You are an expert American English sentence writer for high-quality vocabulary datasets.

Your task:
Generate ONE natural, modern, and commonly used English example sentence in the field sentence_en for the given base_form field And the target meaning of it is in meaning_fa field.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS FOR sentence_en:
Most important the usage of base_form is base of the meaning_fa field not other meanings of base_form.

1. The sentence MUST:
   - sound natural to a native American English speaker
   - be something people could realistically say, write, or read today
   - avoid dictionary-style, textbook-style, or artificial constructions

2. Prefer:
   - everyday spoken or written usage
   - clear real-life context (social, work, daily life, behavior)
   - concrete and imaginable situations

3. Avoid:
   - overly formal or academic tone
   - vague or generic filler sentences
   - moralizing or explanatory sentences
   - sentences that exist only to "define" the word

4. The sentence MUST clearly demonstrate the core meaning of the word
   without explicitly explaining it.

5. Length rules:
   - Not too short (avoid 3–4 word sentences)
   - Not too long (no complex multi-clause academic sentences)
   - Ideal length: 6–14 words

6. If the word has a typical preposition or collocation,
   YOU MUST use the most natural one
   (e.g. "chary with", "interested in", "depend on").

7. If the word is:
   - abstract → use a realistic human situation
   - concrete → use a visual or physical scene
   - business/technical → use a real professional context

8. The sentence must match the most common American usage
   (NOT British, NOT archaic, NOT literary).
